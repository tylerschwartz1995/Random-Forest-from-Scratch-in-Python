# Random-Forest-from-Scratch-in-Python
Programming random forest from scratch using Python.

# Summary
The goal of this module is to reproduce the Random Forest algorithm from scratch.

We will propose to the user as much as flexibility as possible:
- Categorical vs Regression
- Categorical feature transformation (One-Hot-Encoding, Target-Encoding, Frequency-Encoding)
- Possibility to handle missing values with different sort of imputation
- Parallelisation of the CART tree building

Building the random forest from scratch means:
- Building the CART tree algorithm
- Bagging of the data
- Random sampling of the feature
